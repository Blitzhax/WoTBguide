            <h2 id="1">1. Armor (and) Penetration</h2>
            <p>You may have already noticed that there are armor and penetration values for each tank in the game.
                Obviously when your penetration value is higher than your enemy's armor value, it will penetrate.
                However, both values are nearly never the same nor accurate depending on the situation.
                Penetration will not increase (except equipment -> future chapter), it can decrease if you shoot a
                target from long distance. That's why you may not always pen your target while sniping.
                How much it decreases depends on your shell type. <br>For armor, it can both increase and decrease
                drastically depending on how it's angled. Have a look at the picture for visualisation.</p>
            <img src="../images/Effective_armour_thickness.png">

            <p>There is also spaced armor, which is an extra plate on top of the hitbox. It decreases pen of the shell
                that goes through it. HE ammo doesn't go through.
                <br>If you see people talking about a highroll or a lowroll, a lowroll is when you inflict less damage
                than your alpha damage, opposite for highroll. F.e. the IS-3 has 400 alpha, if he inflicts 350 damage
                then he does a lowroll.<br>
                A maxroll is when you deal the highest damage possible for your shell. You can know if you did a maxroll
                by a special sound effect and a "!" in front of the number.
            </p> <br>
            <h2 id="2">2. Shell Types</h2>
            <p>
                In WoTB, you have about 6 shell types.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The 4 most common types:
                    <ul>
                        <li>AP<br> Most tanks have this as their default shell.</li><br>
                        <li>APCR<br> Sometimes default shell, usually prammo (premium ammo type). It has more pen and
                            better velocity than AP.
                        </li><br>
                        <li>HE<br> High Explosive: Present on most tanks, very low pen but way higher damage. Explodes
                            on the first thing it touches, so it doesn't go through obstacles or spaced armor.
                            If it doesn't penetrate, it will cause splash damage based on the gun caliber and how many
                            modules it can damage. The higher the gun caliber of the shooting party, the more
                            splash damage it will inflict. If you splash f.e. between the turret and the hull, it will
                            do slightly more damage than if you just hit the turret. HE can also do 0 splash damage if
                            it hits
                            external modules, like the gun barrel. It can still destroy the gun temporarly, but won't
                            affect the HP. Tracks also count as external.
                        </li><br>
                        <li>HEAT<br> Prammo (except for T49 and Vindicator), explosive like HE except it has way more
                            pen but lower damage. It has the worst velocity of all shell types (not confirmed).
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    HESH<br> Rarely used, simular mechanics like HE. HESH has the highest alpha damage of all types and
                    has more penetration than HE. However not as much as AP or APCR.
                    Most commonly used in British tanks, exceptions are the Ru 251 and the leKpz M41 90MM (german). The
                    icon of HESH is slightly darker orange than HE. Most popular tank that uses HESH in the FV215b 183
                    with a whopping 1200 alpha damage.
                </li><br>
                <li>Premium AP<br>This is a confusing one since most people won't count it as an actual seperate type.
                    Even I don't know the full details, but from experience I assume the values depend on the nation.
                    Tanks that use this ammotype are some Japanese tanks and the SU-100Y. On the SU, you have AP and
                    premium AP. In this case, the premium AP has *lower* pen but more damage than the regular AP.
                    However on some Japanese tanks, it's the opposite. The premium AP has more pen but lower damage like
                    it's usually the case with prammo.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>As for how to use them, it's quite simple. In a normal case where you have AP/APCR, APCR/HEAT and HE
                available, you check if you can pen anywhere with HE first because it has the highest potential damage.
                However if you're on mobile, the time between checking if you can pen, realising you can't and switching
                back, will waste time. If you have time, check ArmorInspector in the App/Play Store (for Blitz, not WoT
                PC) to see where you can pen on certain tanks.<br>
                If you're on playing on PC, you can switch very fast between shells using keybinds (next step).<br>
                <br>Anyways, you check for HE first, then you try AP. If you can't pen, don't be afraid to switch to
                prammo. Yes it costs slightly more credits and you may be short on that, but once you are a way better
                player and find your favourite (preferably OP) premium tank, you'll earn those credits back in no time.
                <br>Personally I was literally always short on credits, having little to no credits left after
                purchasing a new tank. Then I improved a lot as a player and found the Progetto 46 as my soulmate.<br>
                After falling in love with it, I played about 200-500 battles with premium account and credit boosters
                on. Since then I've never been short on credits again. I racked up over 20 million credits and never
                fell below 10 million again since then. <br>
                After participating in events and opening the free crates everyday, you basically get infinite free
                premium account especially with the (even free) battlepasses. I've been on "30 days of premium account
                left" since summer 2020. It just doesn't stop. <br>
                <br> Now back on subject, if you always have that premium account and switch regulary between grinding
                xp and playing premium tanks, you don't have to worry at all about your credits.
                <br>So go ahead and shoot prammo if you need to, don't be afraid to fire it all when needed to pull off
                that win and get some extra damage, because that's what it's all about. In case you don't know how
                exactly to use HE, I will further explain later in chapter "Aiming for weakspots".
            </p><br>
            <h2 id="3">3. Settings and Controls/Keybinds</h2>
            <p>If you want to play well, you have be comfortable with your playing envirement. Configuring your settings
                is defenetly a must.<br>
                To begin, you should have fluent gameplay. FPS is more imporant than graphics, so lower your settings
                untill you have a consistant 60 fps, 120 if possible. 30 can do the trick if you have an older device
                but I can't promise you the same results.
                Grass in sniper mode should always be disabled. When it comes to markers, you should have at least the
                HP and tank model enabled for both ally and enemy. For ally you can enable reload bar and spotted allies
                aswell. <br>
                For the HUD tab, you have to enable minimap, range finder, attention to sector and reload the timer.</p>
            <h3>&nbsp;Mobile</h3>
            <p>Adjusting Touch Controls are very important to make your finger placement more comfortable. You can
                change the size of the buttons and their positioning to your liking. Although you'll find this first in
                the settings, you should keep this for last.
                <br> Auto-aim should be "with button" for when you're shooting over a longer distance as auto-aim
                doesn't work that well in that case. The lookout area and ammo bar have to be enabled.<br>
                Hint: If you enable "same control mode only" you won't face PC players, since they tend to have
                advantages over mobile players in terms of aiming and FOV. All the other settings are up to your
                preferences.
            </p>
            <h3>&nbsp;PC</h3>
            <p>Choose your keybinds to what is comfortable for your hand. Every important keybind should be in reach of
                your default position when you're driving. Quick messages like "Affirmative!" do not belong to the
                important ones.<br>
                You have to be able to press every consumable and shell type without having to move your hand and
                without looking at the keyboard. You can't lose focus from your monitor.
                Although there are a couple things you can't change. One of the most important ones is auto-aim. Since
                there is no unique keybind for "lookout area" as it's called on mobile, you cannot change auto-aim to
                anything other than right click. Else you will lose the ability to use the lookout area.<br>
                From other games I assume you're used to having Aim as right click, well for WoTB you'll have to let
                loose of that habit... Going in and out sniper mode should go with the scroll wheel.
                As last for controls, you should disable automatic zoom. Being able to zoom manually by scrolling
                multiple times is a big advantage in almost every situation.<br>
                All the other settings are up to your preferences.</p><br>
            <h2 id="4">4. Auto(re)loaders</h2>
            <p>These are fairly simple to understand, but worth mentioning for new players non the less.<br>
                Normal guns shoot 1 shell and then reload. Autoloaders can shoot multiple shells (with very small
                loading times between), then have a larger reload time.
                In case you want to reload and still have a shell left in the barrel, you can reload it without shooting
                at nothing and wasting a shell. On mobile you can double tap on your current selected shell type.
                On pc you have a specific keybind for it.<br><br>
                For auto<b>re</b>loaders, it's simular but better. You have multiple shells ready aswell except they
                reload 1 by 1 instead of all at the same time. This is obviously a better system and superior to regular
                autoloaders. Autoloaders generally have a higher alpha per shot, but that's not nessecarily better.
            </p><br>
            <h2 id="5">5. Spotting & Camo</h2>
            <p>Spotting range is from how far away your tank can spot an enemy vehicle. Light tanks are the best
                spotters, with mediums in second (although can depend on the tank).
                In order to spot someone, your spotting points of the hitbox of your tank have to make contact with
                those of the enemy. Those points are located on the most external positions of your hitbox
                obviously. Spotting range can be increased with equipment.<br>
                Another way to spot someone can be without seeing eachother. When you are 50 or less meters away from
                eachother, you will both get spotted no matter what is between you. <br>
                However if an enemy tank is within your spotting range it doesn't mean that it will get spotted. That's
                where camo(uflage) values come into play. There are multiple factors that decide your camo value. The
                consistant ones are from applying a camouflage (surprise) and the base value. However the inconsistant
                variables are usually more important.<br> One of those is the state of your tank. While standing still,
                your value is the highest (turret movement doesn't count). Moving decreases your camo and shooting even
                more. Doing the last 2 at the same results in the worst camo value. It can also be increased by
                equipment, but that only comes into play when you're standing still for at least 3 seconds which is not
                worth it unless you're in a TD. The last factor is map cover, like a bush or a knocked over tree. It's
                not much but could make the difference.<br> BUT that does not mean you have to camp in a bush! Unless
                you're a TD, you WILL in most cases piss off your team and ruin the battle.
            </p><br>
            <h2 id="6">6. The Holy Angles</h2>
            <p>Being able to angle your tank correctly builds a strong foundation for nearly every other technique. This
                won't be easy to explain over text, so if you don't understand after reading then you should probably
                find a video on YouTube about it.<br>
                Angleing is turning your hull and turret in a specific way so your armor thickness increases for the
                enemy that's shooting you. If you look back at <a href="#1">the first point of basics</a>, you'll see in
                the picture. The goal is to make it as hard as possible for your enemy to hit you. Every tank has its
                own specific angles you need to learn. To do it effectivly you need to have seen your tank from your
                enemy his point of view. Knowing what your tank looks like without seeing it. For most tanks it's
                turning slightly sideways and your turret straight. There are also cases like German heavies in which
                you have to angle your turret too. Or pike noses like IS-7 where you need to keep everything straight or
                with a slight angle. Wiggleing your tank is an important part aswell. Constantly moving your weak spots
                around will make it harder to hit you too. But be carefull, it's possible to overangle. If you turn too
                far you can expose other weakpoints. The Maus in the picture is an example of an overangle. <br>He
                turned
                too far and exposed his side.</p> <img src="../images/mausoverangle.jpg" width="300px"><br><br>
