            <h2 id="1">1. Sidescraping</h2>
            <p>By always using angles you might get a couple more bounces, not very much. Your tank is still exposed to
                the
                enemy, if they have experience they'll probably pen you anyways.
                So to solve that, one of the solutions is sidescraping. You hide your lowerplate on the front (biggest
                weakspot) and part of your turret preferably.</p>
            <img src="../images/Sidescrape_Position.png" width="280px">
            <p>Looking at the picture, you can see that the side armor is at a very steep angle and the lowerplate is
                hidden. If you want to shoot, you reverse away from the obstacles but make sure your lowerplate stays as
                hidden as possible. A very common mistake is making an overangle. This happens when you turn too far and
                they can hit your side. This technique won't always work as perfectly depending on the situation. <br>
                IMPORTANT is to NOT sidescrape in tanks with weak side armor like every American tank (at least in
                higher tiers).
                Concerning weak turrets, the only thing you can really do is wiggle. For tanks like Maus and E100 with
                straight plates, angle it sideways like on the picture from Basics point 6.</p>
            <br>
            <h2 id="2">2. Hulldown</h2>
            <p>Hulldown is generally a better strategy than sidescraping, because with sidescraping you have both turret
                and part hull still exposed. In hulldown, you completely hide your hull and only have your turret
                exposed.</p>
            <img src="../images/Hull-down-terrain-world-of-tanks.png" width="280px">
            <p>You probably won't be in the situation shown in the picture regulary. It's more likely that you'll be
                near a hill. There comes the gun depression into play. Gun depression is how much your gun can go down
                in degrees. (Some tanks like German meds get increased gun depression when pointing the gun over your
                side.) There is also gun elevation, which is how much your gun can point up. But when in hulldown, you
                should use the maximum amount of gun depression you can get.</p>
            <img src="../images/hull_down_2.png" width="280px">
            <p>If you're in a situation like this where the enemy doesn't have enough gun depression, you can easily win
                as long as you stay low enough in case you have a hatch on top of your turret. If both you and your
                enemy have a lot of gun depression in this situation, the one with the highground will most likely win
                unless your turret is very strong and his isn't.</p>
            <p>In case you barely lack gun depression, you can still give yourself more by driving one of your tracks up
                a hill or anything higher than the surface. Although, make sure to always stay low enough so they can't
                hit your hull. In most cases they can and will pen even the smallest pixel they can see.</p>
            <p>You can also see that if your tank is facing upwards, your frontal hull plate will increase in thickness
                which can be used to trick your enemy into shooting and bouncing if you try it and execute it perfectly.
            </p><br>
            <h2 id="3">3. Facehugging</h2>
            <p>In most cases, facehugging is a technique that should be used as a last resort. There are exceptions
                where facehugging is favourible, but if that's so then you'll know when it occurs. Usually it happens
                when there is no cover and the enemy is too close already. This is hard to explain but I will try.<br>
                Facehugging is when 2 tanks go "face to face" so they can anticipate on eachothers shots. *not sure how
                to continue, suggestions are welcome on discord (link at bottom)*</p>
